# Triple L Number Specification

## Version 0.1 (Draft)

**Status:** Draft Proposal

---

# 1. Introduction

The **Triple L (Life Long Learner) Number** is an open specification for uniquely identifying learners across lifelong learning communities.

Unlike institution-specific admission numbers or student IDs, the Triple L Number belongs to the learner rather than to any organisation. It remains constant throughout the learner's lifetime and can be used across multiple organisations, learning communities and software platforms.

The Triple L Number is one component of the broader **Lifelong Learning Framework**, an open initiative exploring better ways of understanding, documenting and supporting lifelong learning.

---

# 2. Purpose

The Triple L Number aims to provide a simple, open and interoperable identification system that enables lifelong documentation of learning while remaining independent of any particular school, organisation or software.

The standard is designed to support:

* Lifelong learning archives
* Observation-based documentation
* Collaboration between learning communities
* Open-source educational software
* Long-term research
* Learner-owned records

---

# 3. Design Principles

The Triple L Number is designed around the following principles:

* The learner owns the identity.
* The identity belongs to the learner for life.
* The standard is independent of any organisation.
* Existing international standards are reused wherever possible.
* The specification should remain human-readable.
* Software implements the standard but does not define it.
* The standard is intended to be openly governed by the community.

---

# 4. Number Format

The Triple L Number consists of five parts.

Example:

**IN-KL-0001-0001-01**

| Field | Description                 |
| ----- | --------------------------- |
| IN    | Country (ISO 3166-1)        |
| KL    | Region / State (ISO 3166-2) |
| 0001  | Organisation Number         |
| 0001  | Learning Centre Number      |
| 01    | Learner Number              |

The first two fields follow existing ISO standards.

The remaining fields are defined by the Triple L Number Specification.

---

# 5. Organisation Number

Each organisation adopting the Triple L Standard receives a unique Organisation Number through the Triple L Registry.

The Organisation Number:

* identifies the learning organisation
* remains unique within an ISO Region
* does not change if the organisation expands

The Organisation Number is intended solely to ensure uniqueness.

---

# 6. Learning Centre Number

Each registered organisation may establish one or more learning centres.

Each centre receives a Learning Centre Number assigned by the organisation itself.

The current recommendation is that each learning centre should support no more than **99 active learners**. Rather than growing indefinitely, organisations are encouraged to establish additional learning centres that maintain small, community-oriented learning environments.

---

# 7. Learner Number

Each learner within a learning centre receives a Learner Number.

The Learner Number:

* identifies the learner within that learning centre
* remains constant throughout the learner's participation in that centre
* forms the final component of the Triple L Number

The Learner Number is intentionally limited to two digits (01–99), reflecting the recommendation that each learning centre should remain small enough to provide meaningful attention to every learner.

---

# 8. Documentation

For everyday observation and documentation, it is usually unnecessary to use the complete Triple L Number.

Observers typically use only the local identifier consisting of:

Learning Centre Number + Learner Number

Example:

**000101**

Within the same learning centre this may be shortened further where appropriate.

Example:

**0101**

The complete Triple L Number remains the learner's permanent global identifier.

---

# 9. Observation Documentation

The Triple L Number is intended to support structured observation.

The recommended observation format is:

* Learner Number
* Observer
* Activity
* Observation
* Interpretation (optional)

Example:

```
Learner Number: 000101

Observer:
Sneha (Parent)

Activity:
Nature Walk

Observation:
Stopped several times to observe insects and asked questions about mushrooms.

Interpretation:
(optional)
```

The observer's role is recorded separately and is not part of the learner's identity.

---

# 10. Registry

The Triple L Registry exists to maintain uniqueness of Organisation Numbers.

The registry does not:

* own learner data
* maintain observation records
* control software implementations

Its purpose is limited to maintaining the numbering standard.

The long-term goal is for the registry to be maintained through an open community governance model.

---

# 11. Relationship to the Lifelong Learning Framework

The Triple L Number is one specification within the broader Lifelong Learning Framework.

Future specifications may include:

* Observation Protocol
* Documentation Protocol
* Learning Archive Specification
* Privacy Protocol
* AI Guidelines
* Data Exchange Specification
* Open APIs

Each specification is intended to remain modular so that organisations may adopt individual components independently.

---

# 12. Reference Implementations

The Triple L Number is software-independent.

Possible implementations include:

* Paper records
* Printed observation forms
* Google Keep
* Google Sheets
* SQLite databases
* Mobile applications
* Web applications
* Future open-source implementations

Any implementation that follows this specification remains compatible with the Triple L Standard.

---

# 13. Governance

The Triple L Number is intended to evolve as an open community standard.

Version 0.1 is proposed by Walking Ferns as the initial reference implementation.

As adoption grows, future versions should be developed through an open and transparent community governance process.

---

# 14. Version History

## Version 0.1 (Draft)

Initial proposal including:

* Triple L Number format
* Organisation Number
* Learning Centre Number
* Learner Number
* Documentation format
* Registry concept

---

# 15. Open Questions

The following topics remain open for discussion and future versions of the specification:

* Size of Organisation Number allocation
* Registry governance model
* Organisation registration process
* Reserved numbering ranges
* Learner migration between organisations
* Internationalisation beyond the initial registry
* Long-term sustainability of the registry
